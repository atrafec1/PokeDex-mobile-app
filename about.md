PokeFinder allows the user to search for quick info about any Pokemon simply by typing its name and clicking the search button.
Search results include an image of the Pokemon, its height, weight, and even type! This data is asynchronously accessed through
the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co), where info such as the Pokemon height, weight, type, and image are stored. Further documentation
for this API can be found at https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
